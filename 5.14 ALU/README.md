To implement working of an ALU(Arithmetical Logical Unit) in Verilog.
The operations performed alongwith the op-code numbers are mentioned below
1. ADD A and B
2. ADD A and B and Carry in
3. SUB A and B, will subtract B from A
4. SUB A and B and Borrow in
5. INCREMENT A by 1
6. DECREMENT A by 2
7. NOT A
8. A AND B
9. A OR B
10. A XOR B
11. ROTATE LEFT the value of A by one unit
12. ROTATE RIGHT the value of A by one unit
13. LOGICAL and ARITHMETIC LEFT SHIFT, shifts the value of A by one unit and inserts 0 at LSB
14. Arithmetic RIGHT SHIFT, keeps the MSB and RIGHT SHIFT all the bits including MSB
15. Logical RIGHT SHIFT, RIGHT SHIFT all the bits of A, and insert 0 at MSB
16. Rotate Right through Carry, ROTATE RIGHT ALONGWITH Carry bit
