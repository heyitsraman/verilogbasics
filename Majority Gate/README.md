To implement the logic behind a Majoirty gate (which throws an output 1, when the number of 1's in the data is strictly greater than number of 0's).
Code logic: traversing through the bits and increase the count variable by one whenever a 1 is detected. If the number of 1's is greater than half
the length of bit-width, we should get output as 1.

Here the number of bits/variables is parameterized.
